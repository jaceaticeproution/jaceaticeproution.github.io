                        "AD MELORIA" is an ultimate collection of thoughts, feelings and words that Jace tries to expose by his songs, but which he would never tell anybody in real life. Like euphoria, but exactly meloria is the goal he wills to achieve through journey named life. Contraversional, neither happy nor sad, but full of breathtaking moments that formed artist's personality - such cases and even more you are suggested to listen in this incoming album.
